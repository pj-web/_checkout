<h2>→ How to get started</h2>
<p>Login to your account at https://abezrukov.tradingview.com/#partner-program/links /
<h2>→ How to create affiliate links</h2>
<p>Create a referral link to any TradingView page by adding ?offer_id=10&aff_id=<affiliate_id>  to the end of the page URL address or use the Link Builder. https://www.tradingview.com/referral-program/#linkbuilder </p>
<p>E.g. the link referring to Apple stock page should look as follows:</p>
<p>https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AAPL/?offer_id=10&aff_id=<affiliate_id> </p>
<p>To check your Affiliate ID number, please go to Account Details.</p>
<h2>→ Choose your preferred advertising option</h2>
<p>— Links with a tracking code that are vitally important for traffic acquisition via articles, forum signatures and reviews.</p>
<p>— Unobtrusive banner ads.</p>
<h2>→ Promote us with confidence and authority – we are beyond the competition</h2>
<p>We’ve been working on real-time charts and charting tools for more than 10 years and now we want to share our revenue with you. We offer a 30% lifetime commission on every paying user you bring to TradingView. You can earn up to $179.7 from a single referral’s purchase.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that users tend to activate their 30-day trial subscription firstly. Be patient during that period, and you’ll be able to reap the rewards of increased payments.</p>
p>Keep in mind that you will be paid only for new users. This means that if a person registered a TradingView account earlier the system wouldn’t identify this user as a new one and therefore you won’t be paid. </p>
<p>We want you to know that our temporary partners at HasOffers sometimes can’t provide you with accurate information regarding your revenue. However, you are free to ask us and get a
correct data anytime.</p>
<h2>→ How to get paid</h2>
<p>Please don’t forget to include your PayPal email address in order to receive commissions. Otherwise, you won’t be able to get a payout and your reward will be rejected in 12 months.</p>
<h2>→ Questions?</h2>
<p>Get in touch with your personal 24/5 Affiliate Manager at partners@tradingview.com. We are happy to help with best practices and personal tips on how to achieve maximum efficiency.  </p>  Sincerely,
TradingView
